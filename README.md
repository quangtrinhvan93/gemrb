## Introduction:

[GemRB](https://gemrb.org) (Game Engine Made with preRendered Background) is a portable open-source
reimplementation of the Infinity Engine that underpinned Baldur's Gate,
Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment. It sports a cleaner design, greater
extensibility and several innovations.
Would you like to create a game like Baldur's Gate?

To try it out you either need some of the ORIGINAL game's data or you can
get a tiny sneak peek by running the included trivial game demo.

The original game data has to be installed if you want to see anything but
the included trivial demo. On non-windows systems either copy it over from
a windows install, use a compatible installer, WINE or extract it manually
from the CDs using the unshield tool.

Documentation can be found on the [website](https://gemrb.org/Documentation),
in `gemrb/docs/` and the [gemrb.6 man page](https://gemrb.org/Manpage.html).

If you want to help out, start by reading this
list of [options, tips and priorities](https://github.com/gemrb/gemrb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
